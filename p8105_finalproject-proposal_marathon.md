# P8105 Final Project Proposal

## Motivation for This Project

We are interested in learning more about Boston Marathon runners. We
would like to know:

-   What are the overall demographics of participants?
-   What are the demographics of winners?
-   Are demographics consistent over the 3 year sample period (2015,
    2016, 2017) and between genders?
-   How do the demographics of “successful” runners differ by half
    marathon and full marathon times?
-   Is 5k time a strong predictor of marathon time?

## Intended Final Products

We will present a website with the visualization and explanations of our
findings as well as a written report with analysis details and findings.

## Anticipated Data Sources

We will be combining three different datasets (below) for our three year
study period. This data is pulled from kaggle.com

-   [2015](https://www.kaggle.com/rojour/boston-results?select=marathon_results_2015.csv)
-   [2016](https://www.kaggle.com/rojour/boston-results?select=marathon_results_2016.csv)
-   [2017](https://www.kaggle.com/rojour/boston-results?select=marathon_results_2017.csv)

## Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges

We intend to create:

-   A dashboard with bar charts of demographics of participants and
    winners.
-   A linear model with finished time as the outcome and age, country,
    and gender as predictors.
-   A plot of marathon winners and demographics over time.

A coding challenge could be combining 3 large datasets, as well as
issues with multiple people working on the same code as once, such as
overwriting.

## Planned Timeline

This is the rough timeline we plan to follow in order to stay on track
and finish this project by the deadline:

-   November 16-19: Project review meeting
-   November 20th: Data cleaning
-   November 24th: Visualizations
-   November 28th: Linear Model
-   December 1st: Webpage
-   December 5th: Video
-   December 9th: Report
-   December 11th: Turn in final products!
